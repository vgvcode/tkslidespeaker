Here's an example of how far we have come in the last 50 years.

In 1970, the microprocessor (Intel 4004) had 2300 transistors. Today, NVIDIA's AI Chip has 54 Billion transistors.

In 1970, it was impossible to buy 1TB of storage. Cost was more than $1 Million or Rs 8 crores. 
Today, you can buy a 1TB hard drive for less than Rs 5000.
