Today's iPhone or Android phone is several times more powerful than the computer that was used for the first Apollo 11 landing on the moon.

Imagine what you can do with such power in your hands. This is why we see so many interesting apps in our phones today. Some of these can do complex things like Facial recognition, Speech Synthesis and so on.
