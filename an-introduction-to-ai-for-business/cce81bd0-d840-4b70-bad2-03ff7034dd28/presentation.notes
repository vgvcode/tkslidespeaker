Now let's switch topics and look into the field of AI itself.

AI or Artificial Intelligence was defined as the science of making intelligent machines a definition from 1956.

Then came a subset of AI called Machine Learning, which is about making computers learn from the data by building their own rules.

Then we have another subset called Deep Learning which uses neural networks. This concept has its origin to the way the brain works using neurons.

And now we have Generative AI, which takes AI to a whole new level, as we will see in the examples shortly. It is based on something called Transformer Architecture which I will not get into today.
