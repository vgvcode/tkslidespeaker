Employ smart robots and IOT in the factory.
Deploy smart robots with cameras and AI capabilities to perform simple quality checks of bicycle parts. 
Reassign humans to perform more complex checks and value added tasks rather than simple inspections. 

Use sensors (IOT) on the factory floor to capture machine operating data. 
Analyze this data using AI to see if a machine needs to be serviced (predictive maintenance). Predicting failures early will avoid costly downtime.
