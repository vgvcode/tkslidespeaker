But, there's another reason why we need Data. 
It is for Machine Learning. Computers are good at learning rules from data. 
However, they need lots of data to learn and come up with the rules by themselves. 
For example, in order for a computer to recognize a defect in a bicycle part, we need to feed it several thousands of images of the part, both defective and non defective. 
We call this labeling.
