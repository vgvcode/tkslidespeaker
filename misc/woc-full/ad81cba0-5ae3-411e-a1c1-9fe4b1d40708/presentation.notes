Alarmed by the latest trend, Linda, the Chief People Officer, requested an emergency meeting with Sonya. 
"I'm not surprised", said Sonya, after hearing the developments. 
"We need to look at this positively. Let us encourage these discussions. 
We should aim for more transparency, not less. 
At the same time, let us also conduct seminars and awareness sessions on how technology can create more jobs for people." 
"Sure", said Linda. 
"But we need to give some more confidence to those on the ground. 
For example, what can we tell the line workers who feel their job can be replaced by a much cheaper robot?"
