Sonya and the leadership committee were very impressed by this demo. 
"This is fantastic. Can a customer access this app if they don't have an Alexa?", asked Sonya. 
The project engineer replied, "Customers can access this chatbot from their mobile phones (using Siri, by downloading our Cozmonaut App on Apple, for example). 
Besides Alexa, we are also making this app available on Google's voice assistant. 
And customers can also access it by clicking the 'Chat with us' Button on our website".

"I'm impressed", remarked Phil.
