Ray went on to the next topic. "Here's another issue. 
We received complaints that our social media sentiment app may be violating privacy. For example, during our trials, a customer had posted some pictures of a bicycle race on Facebook. 
Our app seemed to have figured out the date, location and other details about the customer without them revealing it. 
The customer felt their privacy was violated!", Ray continued.
