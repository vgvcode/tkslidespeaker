"Yes, I'm well aware of this problem. How do you propose to solve it?", Ray interjected. The partner continued, "One way we can improve this is by automating your quality checks. You can apply Artificial Intelligence, devices equipped with sensors and cameras to identify defective parts and take corrective action. 
Machines can do most of the basic checks quickly and efficiently. 
Human intervention can be used only when necessary. 
This way you can go through your checks much faster." 
He paused, anxiously waiting for Ray to respond.
