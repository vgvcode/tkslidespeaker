We have had great reviews about our 'Cozmonaut, where's my bike?" app. 
This app is available on mobile phones and popular voice assistants such as Alexa, Siri and Google. Using this app, our customers could check on their order, get estimated delivery dates, add more items to the order and so on. 
Needless to say, it has reduced the load in our call centers. 
Our customers are excited. 
And it has given us a digital identity that our competitors don't have.
