The bike had wifi and bluetooth to relay information to the rider either via their mobile phone or via earphones attached to their helmets. 
The bike was also able to seamlessly connect with a lot of wearables attached to the rider, such as a wrist watch, socks with wearable devices and so on. 
It also had an electric rechargeable battery (available as an accessory) that could be fitted to the bike. 
This would allow the bike to go for about 80 miles, without a human pedaling it. It was great for urban bikers. 
And most important of all, the bikes had a sleek, new look that would appeal to young and old alike.
