At school, your teacher rewarded you when you did something well, or admonished you when you did not. 
Through a system of rewards and punishments, you learned what was the right behavior. Machines also learn through this process. 
During training, humans will provide feedback to the machines on whether they got the results right or not. 
Machines use this feedback to make their own rules. For example, a self driving car or a robot is often trained this way to recognize obstacles. 
This is called reinforced learning.
