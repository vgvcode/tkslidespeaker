Well before last quarter's results, it was clear for the CEO Phil, that Cozmo Bicycles needed new leadership. 
He was keenly aware of the steady decline of the company over the years. 
He understood that what took them from "good to great" over the last 25 years may not be enough to keep them there. 
They needed someone who could look at their business with a fresh set of eyes. 
Someone who could understand their current base of customers better than he could.
