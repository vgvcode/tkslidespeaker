"Are applications like Chat GPT sentient?", another manager asked. 
"No, that is a myth. Machines do not have feelings. 
Chat GPT is trained on a vast body of knowledge, so it 'appears' like it is capable of thinking and having feelings. At its core is a Large Language Model, that knows how to respond well to any question, or what is the best thing to say, based on probabilities. 
It is not sentient. Just a smart piece of software"
