"Well, to begin with, the model can be improved. 
It needs to be trained to identify defects better. 
What we see is a common problem in A I caused by an imbalance in the training data. 
Our model was trained on far too many 'good cases', that is, no defects and far too few 'bad cases', that is defects. 
In other words, our data was skewed. 
So our A I could not learn well to identify the defects. 
If we correct this imbalance in our training data, we may be able to achieve much better accuracy. In fact, accuracy rates of 98-99% are not uncommon", said Swami. 
"And that is not all. When the A I system is not confident about its prediction (as measured by a confidence score), we can route that case to a human agent. So in our case, we can augment the A I with humans. With this method, we may achieve even better results than humans!"
