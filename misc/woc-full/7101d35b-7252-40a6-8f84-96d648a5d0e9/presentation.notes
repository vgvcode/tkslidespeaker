Last quarter's performance was a wake up call for all of us. 
Let us not forget that we are still one of the most trusted brands in the industry. 
We have a long tradition of excellence and a rich history of building high quality products. 
We have customers across three major continents. 
This setback provides us all with a golden opportunity to reinvent ourselves. 
We have survived many challenges to our business over the last five decades. 
Make no mistake, we are going to blow past this one as well. 
But, we have work to do. I want every one of you - engineers, managers, administrators - to use this as a catalyst for change.
