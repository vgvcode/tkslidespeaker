Rob was hired by Phil more than 20 years ago. 
He played a big part in the company's transition from an OEM to a brand with a strong identity of its own.
For many old timers, Rob was 'Mr. Cozmo'. 
But to others, Rob was a man from a different era. 
He seemed to be out of touch with the current generation of bike riders.
