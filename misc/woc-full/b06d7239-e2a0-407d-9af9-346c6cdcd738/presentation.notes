Meet Olga, the new Data Queen at Cozmo. 
Olga joined Cozmo about three years ago in the marketing department. 
A sharp mind and a quick study, she caught the attention of everyone in a short time, with her grasp of the business. 
As a trained mathematician, she was able to articulate the need for analytics very well to everyone. 
This came in very handy in her new role, as we will see. 
Soon, she was promoted as the Head of Analytics at Cozmo. 
One of her first tasks was to meet with Linda, to discuss how to build the new Analytics Department.
