A common trait you will see in all machine learning approaches above, is that programmers do not explicitly code the rules. 

By going through the millions of data samples, computers actually 'learn' to write the rules themselves. 
Machines are very good at writing these rules. 
Imagine how many rules one has to write to recognize a person's face - rules for the shape of eyes, length of nose, color of skin and so on. Humanly impossible! 
But machines can do this very easily, if properly trained!", said Swami.
