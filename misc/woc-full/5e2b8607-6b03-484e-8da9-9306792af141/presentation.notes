He followed up with some specific statistics.
1. Last year, only seven percent of our customers were repeat customers. A few years ago, this number used to be close to twenty five percent. 
2. The number of new customers has been steadily decreasing over the years. 
3. Likewise, the lifetime value (LTV) metric for our customers has also been decreasing. So we are having fewer customers, and fewer purchases per customer. 
4. Our average time to resolve a customer complaint has increased from 15 minutes to 1 hour. 
5. We have more than doubled the number of seats in our call centers in Manila but we have not seen a decrease in call resolution time or increase in first call resolution percentage.
