We can add features like get missing parts, place a service request, get product features and so on. 
Statistically, over a third of the calls from customers are for enquiries like this. 
By deflecting these calls to a chatbot, we human agents will be able to use their time to answer more complex calls. 
Our cost per call will decrease. 
Our first time call resolution times will decrease. 
All in all, a huge improvement over what we have currently.
