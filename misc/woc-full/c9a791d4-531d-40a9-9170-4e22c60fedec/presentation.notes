"Cozmo has a solid customer base who still prefer our traditional bicycles. 
We have millions of users in Europe and Asia who still like our utility bicycles. 
And we have loyal customers in US who are so used to our current sports bikes, that they keep buying the same model from us again and again. 
It seems to me that with the new product launch, we may risk alienating our established base of customers. 
Do we really want to cannibalize our own products, which have been our cash cow for years?"
