If used responsibly, A I and Machine Learning can provide great benefits, as we saw at Cozmo. Many of these are applicable to other companies as well. 

Like many, the optimist in me sees great opportunities for human civilization, through the use of A I. Many people envision a golden age, where humans will coexist with A I. So it might not be humans vs A I, but humans with A I. 

Good luck in your A I journey!
