Meanwhile at the factory, we have deployed robots to perform quality inspections on bicycle parts. 
This has greatly reduced the labor costs involved in quality inspection. 
Our robots are able to achieve 98% accuracy on the inspection in the first pass. We have added humans in the loop to improve the quality of inspection to 99%.
