Cozmo Bicycles was established in 1945, by Sam Davidson. Initially they started manufacturing bicycles as an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) and sold them exclusively under other brand names as a private label. 

After about 40 years of doing business this way, Sam passed over the reins of the business to his son Phil. Phil was a bicycle aficionado in his own right, and boldly took the company to a new era. Under his leadership, Cozmo decided to establish its own brand of bicycles and go directly to consumers in North America and countries in Europe.
