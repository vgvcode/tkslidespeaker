Linda answered the question. 
"There are no deadlines. 
We are introducing several courses for business managers and operators. 
You can work with your manager to design a path for yourself to get trained and decide on a time frame to complete it. 
You can decide on what areas you would like to specialize in, choose your courses, learn at your own pace and do this from home or work. 
There are so many wonderful options to choose from. 
And best of all, it is free! Our company is making an investment to provide this training free of cost, to all employees."
