One area that has benefited from this is deep learning, which is a part of machine learning. 
It allows computers to build millions of rules using layers of nodes, somewhat similar to how our brains work with billions of neurons. 
These are called neural networks. 
A computer that recognizes your image is an example of deep learning in action.
