In the past, engineers had to code the rules for machines using software. 
For example a rule could be like, Before crossing the road, look to your left and right to see if there are vehicles approaching. 
If there are vehicles approaching, stop. 
Otherwise, proceed to cross the road. 
Today, computers can learn these rules without being explicitly programmed. I will come to this shortly.
