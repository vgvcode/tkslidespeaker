"And if a customer has a negative review, our app can sense it and trigger workflows based on it. 
Like notify customer service or inform the product manager. '
And the data can be aggregated to see trends over time. 
For example, here's a chart that shows how our Road Warrior bike is trending in social media. 
Based on the last four weeks of data, it has 30% positive reviews, 55% negative reviews and the rest neutral. 
And most of these reviews are from millennials and Gen Z riders", the Product Manager added.
