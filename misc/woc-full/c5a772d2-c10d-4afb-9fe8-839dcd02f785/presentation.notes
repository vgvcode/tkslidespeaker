Now coming to your next question, how do machines actually learn? 
Loosely speaking, they do it much in the same way that we learn as humans. 
As a kid, you were taught to read by being shown lots of text and pictures. 
Your parents and teachers read them aloud for you. 
In the same way, machines are repeatedly shown data with labels on them. 
The data could be the image of a bicycle part, and the label could be whether the part is defective or not. 
Computers need to see several thousand such data samples in order to make up their own rules. 
This is called supervised learning.
