"We need to spread the message that Cozmo is not letting anyone go because of robots. 
This has to be our number one priority. 
Simultaneously, we all need to up-skill or re-skill. We need to equip the line workers you mentioned earlier, with new skills. 
Their jobs will not be taken away, but evolve into something more interesting and challenging", Sonya said. 

"Like what? Can you give an example?", Linda asked. 
"The line worker doing quality checks today, might be designing better products in the future. 
Or they may monitor the work done by many robots, and perform complex tasks that the robots cannot. 
History is full of examples of how jobs evolved over time."
