Phil's epiphany came several months ago, when he wanted to give a bike as a present to his son on his 16th birthday. 
"No, I don't want a Cozmo bike, dad. Your bikes are so boring!" 
"But, Jon, we make some of the best quality bicycles in the industry. And they will last a long time." 
"If you really want to gift me a bike, pick the one from New Horizon. 
Their models are so cool. And they come with the HorizonTell app to connect with all my bike buddies."
