We need to be able to measure everything. For example

 What is the return on investment (ROI) on our marketing campaigns? 
 How many orders were placed from our online store today? 
 How many bicycle parts do we produce per hour? 
 How many products do we ship to our customers per day? 
 What percentage of our products are defective? 
 How do customers rate our ordering and shipping functions ? 
 How do customers rate our product? and so on. Using data, we need to be able to connect the dots, across marketing, sales, customer service and manufacturing.
