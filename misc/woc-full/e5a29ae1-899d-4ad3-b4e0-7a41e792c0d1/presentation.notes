For instance, if the bike met with an accident or got stolen, it was able to communicate with the owner or their family members immediately. 
They called it the Cozmo's phone home feature. Various sensors on board monitored the bike's performance and relayed this information to a central station. 
If the bike needed service or maintenance, Cozmo could detect this and inform the owner in advance. 
Behind the scenes, it was built using an A I based Predictive Maintenance system. 
A GPS device on the bike would be able to provide turn by turn directions and alert bike riders of road accidents and other hazards.
