"The results are in", said the product manager, excitedly. 
"We tested our robot on 10,000 parts in the assembly line. 
It correctly identified 9400 as not defective and 400 as defective. So there were 9800 correct classifications.
However, it also identified 50 as not defective when they were actually defective. 
And 150 as defective when they were not defective. So there were 200 misclassifications".
 "That's not bad, is it? We had only 200 misclassifications in 10,000! That's 2%!", Said Sonya.
