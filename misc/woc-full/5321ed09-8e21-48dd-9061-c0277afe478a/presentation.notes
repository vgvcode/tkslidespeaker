"First, we need people with deep experience in handling, analyzing and interpreting data - this would be the data scientists and data analysts. 
Second, we need to 'leapfrog' our competition into the Age of Artificial Intelligence. 
We need A I / ML scientists who can build our A I enabled future. Like we saw in the demos. 
We need data engineers who can design systems to store and manipulate data. 
Third, we need domain experts from our core business functions. 
People with the latest background in manufacturing and industrial engineering who can help us understand the data."
