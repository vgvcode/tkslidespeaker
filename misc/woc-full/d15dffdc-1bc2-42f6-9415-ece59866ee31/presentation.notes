"This C O E will be our agent for change. 
The team will brainstorm new ideas, build proof of concept solutions and even take one or two ideas to the market within twelve months. 
In some ways, the C O E will be a 'mini company' inside Cozmo with a different set of goals. 
Its purpose is to provide us the vision and take bold steps without being worried about the risk of failure. 
Over the course of time, the ideas from the C O E will permeate the rest of the organization. 
We believe this will be the least disruptive way to take Cozmo Bicycles forward to a new era." Linda left the room, pleased and excited. 
She believed that the initial seeds of change were sown in that meeting!
