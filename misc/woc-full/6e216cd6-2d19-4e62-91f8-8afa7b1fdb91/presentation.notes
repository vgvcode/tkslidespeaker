Forecast sales, predict stock-outs and go J I T! 

We regularly get emails from our distribution centers on excess inventory in some location and stock-outs in another location. 
Bad planning! Every stock-out is a missed sales opportunity! Use AI to forecast product sales, and use the information to avoid stock outs in some locations and excess inventory in others. 

Follow Just In Time inventory management (minimizes cost) instead of Just In Case (leads to overstocking and wastage).
