Jay, the SVP of Customer Service, was a very tech savvy individual. 
Prior to coming to Cozmo, he was leading customer support for a software product startup. 
He was quite familiar with the features of the latest Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software used in the industry. 
Being a bit of a data geek himself, he had already done some research on the problems in the Customer Service department.
