It was the summer of 2024. 
Swami, Olga and Sonya were participating in the Five Boro Bike Tour held in New York. 
Every May, around 32,000 cyclists gear up and traverse all five of New York's boroughs and up and over five major bridges. 
The entire course would be closed to traffic. 
It would be nothing short of spectacular. 
Sonya and Swami felt there was no better way to launch their Renaissance bikes, than in a popular bicycle tour as this one, with three members from the leadership team participating.
