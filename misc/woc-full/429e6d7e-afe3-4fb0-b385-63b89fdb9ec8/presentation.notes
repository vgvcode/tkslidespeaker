Sometimes, you learn something 'intuitively'. 
You know if something is not right or if there's danger around you and you need to flee. 
Nobody taught you this. 
You notice something is different, or you see a pattern that triggers your brain to react. 
Machines also use similar techniques. 
They use mathematics to recognize patterns from data, such as identify similar groups of customers, or detect anomalous behavior. 
This is called unsupervised learning.
