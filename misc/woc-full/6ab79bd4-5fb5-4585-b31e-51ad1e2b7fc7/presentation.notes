Multi-lingual chatbots!

Instead of operating multiple call centers in different regions, use one call center and have AI translate customer queries in the local language to the agents in English. 
And use AI again, to translate the agent's reply back to the customer in their local language. 
Bi-directional translation would save us a ton of money on call centers.
