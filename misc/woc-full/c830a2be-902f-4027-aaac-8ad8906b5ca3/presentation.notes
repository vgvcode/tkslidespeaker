"So where is this all going? If computers are so smart, then will our jobs be replaced?", a manager asked. 
"Computers are definitely getting smarter, but humans are still needed to verify what the computer does or step in when the computer cannot make a decision. 
For example, a robot in the factory floor may be able to perform basic quality checks and inspections, but we will still need a human to verify the results (if the confidence score is low). 
At other times, humans are needed to do the more complex checks. 
This is especially true if the cost of errors is very high (imagine a part being certified as defect free, when it actually isn't. This is known as a false negative). 
We call these human-in-the-loop processes.
