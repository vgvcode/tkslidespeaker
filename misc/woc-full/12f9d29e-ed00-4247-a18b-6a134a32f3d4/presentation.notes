Chief Operating Officer, Ray.

Ray is very process oriented and disciplined. 
Employees call him as X-Ray. 
He is a great believer in Lean manufacturing and Six Sigma. 
He is technology agnostic, and often plays the devil's advocate. 
But always, he has the best interest of the company at heart. 
And, he is not very familiar with A I.
