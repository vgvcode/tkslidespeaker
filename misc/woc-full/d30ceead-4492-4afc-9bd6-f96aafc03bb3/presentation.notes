I hope the story of Cozmo Bicycles resonated with you. The field of A I and Machine Learning is advancing rapidly. 

Around the time I wrote this book, Chat GPT (version 4) was released. It has taken the world by storm. Many are hailing this as one of the greatest inventions of mankind. It is a promising new technology with exciting possibilities, and we have barely scratched the surface! 

Yet many are also worried about an A I 'arms race' developing and the dangers of unregulated A I. There have been calls to pause the development of A I so governments can put appropriate safeguards in place. Pausing the development sounds interesting, but it may not be practical. No one can stop an idea whose time has come.
