Even three months before the event, Swami and Linda were busy working the PR machine to make sure they got all the publicity they needed. 
A month before the tour, there were advertisements and paid commercials on TV, extolling the virtues of Cozmo's Renaissance Family - The Connected Bike of the New Generation. 
Right before the tour, Linda did a live interview on National TV with the three bikers. 
They were all proudly seated on their gleaming Renaissance bikes, sporting Cozmo smart helmets and other Cozmo branded wearables.
