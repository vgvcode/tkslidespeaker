Finally, Swami agreed to be the bad customer and shot out an angry email from his phone. 
"Hey Cozmo, I received the Road Warrior Model 365 yesterday. 
The chain kept slipping off the jockey wheel frequently. 
Feels like shoddy workmanship. 
The handle bar is very wobbly. 
The ride is not at all comfortable. 
On the whole, I'm not impressed and would like to return the product."
