"Alexa, open Cozmonaut", one of the team members commanded the voice assistant on the table.

"Opening Cozmonaut. How can I help you?", asked the voice assistant. 
"Hey Cozmonaut, where's my bike?", the person asked. "I would be happy to check on that for you. 
Just a moment please", said the chatbot. 
After about ten seconds, the chatbot continued, "I checked my records for recent orders from you. 
I see that you placed an order for a Cruiser-X50 model about 2 weeks ago. 
Is this correct?" 

Person: "Yes.".
