"So how do you think we can fix these problems?", Sonya asked. 
"I would start by introducing better technology for Customer Support. 
For instance, we can have AI chatbots to resolve some of our basic customer support issues like delayed shipping or missing products. 
More than 30% of our customer support calls are in this category. 
This will reduce the load in our call centers by deflecting the simple calls to automated agents. A huge cost savings right there!
