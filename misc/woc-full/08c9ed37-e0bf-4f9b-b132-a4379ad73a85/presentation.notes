Olga, the head of Data Analytics, spoke. 
"Our data scientists need to do a much better job of eliminating bias from creeping in with our data. 
Bias can occur when our data sample is not well distributed to represent the population fairly. 

Or, as Swami said, our A I may be inferring gender incorrectly based on the features in the training data. 
For example, 'Sports played' might be highly correlated with 'Gender'. 
We need to review our training data to see if the A I is picking up unintended correlations like this and making wrong inferences.

Secondly, AI provides us with a lot of tools and metrics to detect bias. 
We should incorporate these and track how well our A I is doing on a continuous basis", Olga said.
