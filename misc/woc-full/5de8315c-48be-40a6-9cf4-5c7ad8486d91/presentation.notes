Seeing the confused looks in the leadership team, Rob himself came up with a suggestion. 
"A few months ago, when we launched the Center of Excellence, we wanted to build a suite of experimental products. We wanted to test the market first, and then gradually move these products into the mainstream. 
With that in mind, I propose we create a new family / brand of products in Cozmo called The Renaissance Family. 
This brand will be introduced in a carefully controlled way in selected markets to see how it performs. 
We could have the Renaissance X series for the baby boomers, Renaissance Y series for the millennials and Renaissance Z series for the Gen Z."
