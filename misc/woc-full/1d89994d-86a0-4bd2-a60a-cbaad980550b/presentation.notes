"That is clear now, but why did we not fight back sooner?", Sonya asked. "Great question", Swami continued. 
"Large companies like us, have certain barriers to innovation which make it difficult to invest in disruptive technologies early on. 
We carry a lot of baggage with outdated equipment, training and processes. 
We have an established customer base and risk alienating them with a new product. 
We will have a tough time convincing our employees to adopt disruptive technologies in their work. 
Many of them have had a long tenure of 15-20 years with us and are very proud of what they have accomplished at Cozmo." 
Swami paused, and looked around the room at veterans like Phil and Rob.
