He shared with Sonya, a recent email from a customer. 
"Dear Cozmo Bicycles. 
I ordered a DIY bicycle from you last month. 
I was not happy with the experience. 
First, not all the parts arrived in one package. 
I had to call customer service multiple times to get everything. 
Second, the instructions to set it up were very poor. 
I gave up after trying for two days and went to a bicycle shop to get my bike fixed. 
I'm probably not going to order another bicycle from you again!"
