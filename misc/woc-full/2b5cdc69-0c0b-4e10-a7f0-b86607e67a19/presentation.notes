However, transforming a traditional business to the age of A I is not easy. These companies have people, processes and systems equipped to solve problems differently, from a different era. 

Business processes have to be changed, employees have to be retrained, systems have to be re engineered.

In other cases, companies may have to redesign their products or services, to take advantage of A I. This helps them differentiate their products from competitors and increase sales.
