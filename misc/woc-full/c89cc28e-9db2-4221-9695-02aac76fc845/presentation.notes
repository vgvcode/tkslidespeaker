Sonya Davis was one of the rising stars at Cozmo. 
Although a relative newcomer, she had captured the attention of everyone in Senior Leadership in a short span of time. 
As Global Head of Sales, she was instrumental in setting up a new line of business at Cozmo, by leading their foray into the home fitness segment.

The sudden departure of Phil as CEO, a veteran in the industry, and the elevation of Sonya, a rookie (according to some), caused a lot of ripples inside and outside Cozmo. 
Employees had a lot of questions for Sonya Davis at the next town hall.
