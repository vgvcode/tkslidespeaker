The Product Manager asked one of the members of the leadership team to participate in the demo. 
"We would like one of you to pretend you are an angry customer. 
Please send an email to customersupport@cozmo dot com right now, from your mobile phone, telling us how bad you feel about your recent purchase." 

The members of the leadership team exchanged glances at one another. 
No one stepped forward. 
After all, they were the proud architects of Cozmo and felt uncomfortable to play this role.
