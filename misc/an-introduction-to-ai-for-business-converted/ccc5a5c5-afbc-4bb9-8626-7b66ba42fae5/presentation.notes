Let me start with a brief history tour of the last 75 years of AI.

Research in the field of AI has been going on for years, but for the purposes of our discussion today, I started my journey from 1950. This is when most of us will agree that work in the field of AI started in a meaningful way.

From 1950 - 2000, AI work was mostly theoretical. A lot of papers were published, research was carried out, but there were not many industrial applications built using AI. A notable application was MYCIN which was a Decision Making tool for Doctors. Progress was slow because funding for research stopped at some points (known as AI winters). People were skeptical whether AI will truly live up to its promise. In the late 90's there was an important breakthrough when IBM's Deep Blue beat the world chess champion.

Then from 2000 - 2023 (that is the present), we see a lot of important breakthroughs in AI. Most of this came from the industry. Many practical applications were built using the theory developed several years ago. We will see some of them shortly.

And finally, I want to look at 2023 and beyond in particular. I see 2023 as the Inflection Point for AI. This is the year when Generative
