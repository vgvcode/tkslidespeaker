So people can naturally ask the question - what is driving all this growth in AI? Why were things so quiet in the first 50 years, and then all of a sudden we see so much spike in AI and Machine Learning?

The answer lies in technology.
First, computer chips became more and more powerful. We have the famous Moore's law which states the number of chips in a transistor doubled every two years. Moore's law has held firm for the last 50 0r more years. This meant computers have been getting exponentially better over time.

Second, storage became cheaper every year. This meant people could store a lot of information. And driving this were things like the Internet, Cloud Computing, Social Networks and so on. Think about how many photos you store in your phone today.

The third reason is somewhat connected to the first two. Scientists invented better algorithms that could take advantage of the processing power and storage capacity. The most notable breakthrough here is the rise of Deep Learning or Neural Networks. This is similar to how neurons work in our brains. And now we have LLMs that are trained on all the knowledge available for humanity.
