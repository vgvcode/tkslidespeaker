For me, no visit to Chennai would be complete without seeing Periyasamy. 
In fact, I could not recall a single trip in the last ten years when I had skipped it. 
This time, it was a very rushed trip and I had put it off till the last day. 
When my cab arrived, I checked with my driver if I still had the time for this visit. 
And then I decided to spring him a surprise. 
Periyasamy was in his mid eighties. 
He retired as a high school Math teacher from my alma mater about thirty years ago, and lived in the suburbs of Chennai with his wife.
