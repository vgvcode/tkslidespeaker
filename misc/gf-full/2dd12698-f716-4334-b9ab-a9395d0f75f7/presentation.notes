Intrigued by the business plan, I probe a little further. 
"It all starts with our customers registering online for a wedding. 
They fill out an online application and choose the services they are interested in. 
The bride and groom can get married from the comfort of their living room. 
Two days before the wedding, we send our customer a package containing all necessary equipment to conduct a virtual wedding. 
This includes a 36-inch Smart TV with a built-in camera, speakers, microphones, headphones and internet equipment. 
There's a handy online video to help customers set it up themselves. 
Or, for a small fee, our agent will set it up for them in their home in 30 minutes or less (wearing a mask and gloves, of course!
).
