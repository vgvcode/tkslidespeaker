Mystique Valley: Incorporated 1904. 
Population 3781
Nestled in the foothills of the California coast mountains, about an hour from Los Angeles, is a quiet and peaceful village, largely disconnected from humanity. 
If you drove along the scenic route hugging the Pacific coastline, this city would show up like a blip in the radar, appearing and disappearing in a matter of seconds.
The lush green valley, the breathtaking view of the mountains, the ocean and the tranquil existence made this place a haven for retirees. 
A picture postcard city by the sea. 
Apart from this, the city had no pretensions of glory.
Until now.
