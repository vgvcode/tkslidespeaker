I switched off the lights in my room and retired for the night. 
Brother Valiant sat there on the table, valiant as ever, gleaming in the dark. 
Quiet, sturdy, sleek and impressive. 
An anachronism seated incongruously beside a laptop, a tablet and a wifi printer.

A forlorn reminder of a bygone era!
