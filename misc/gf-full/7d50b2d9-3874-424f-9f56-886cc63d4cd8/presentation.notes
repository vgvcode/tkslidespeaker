"But wait! 
In fact, I believe we might have one in the house. 
Your late grandfather (my dad) was a popular journalist in his time. 
He used to send typewritten documents to magazines and newspapers. 
They would appear in daily / weekly columns as short stories or essays ('middles', as they were called, in The Express or The Mail of those days).
" I spent the next few hours in the attic in a frantic search to locate my dad's old typewriter from 50 years ago. 
I finally found it, sitting in a pile of dust along with fellow time travelers like a 'Grundig Reel to Reel Tape Recorder' ,'Bell & Howell 8mm Projector' and a bundle of unused carbon paper from 'Kores'. 
My dad was a tinkerer. 
He had a mini studio at home and used to make his own home videos. 
Something unheard of in the 70s!
