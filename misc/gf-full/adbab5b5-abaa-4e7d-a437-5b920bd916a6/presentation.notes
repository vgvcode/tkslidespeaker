Day 3 Morning, Return to Normalcy or Calm before the Storm? 


Day 3 was our first return to normalcy. 
Our customer complaints dropped precipitously and returned to the old levels of more than a month ago. 
Everyone in the company heaved a huge sigh of relief. 
We submitted the report of our findings to the CEO. 
Everyone was curious about whether Alex was found. 
The cops finally tracked down Alex and he was brought to the office. 
He was interrogated rigorously for over 8 hours by us and a few experts in Cyber Crime.
