Around noon on the second day, one of the engineers approached me to have a word in private. 
"A few months back, we had a senior software developer by the name Alex, who was in his mid fifties. 
He was a science fiction buff, and used to fondly recall names of old sci-fi movies and characters.
".
"What was Alex working on? 
Where is he now?
".
"Alex worked with the Fraud Detection Team. 
He was creating new algorithms that could improve our ability to identify fraud. 
He left by the end of summer".
