Shanthi Vilas was a senior living community, nestled in a quiet village about three hours from Chennai. 
Set up in a sprawling area over 10 acres in the rustic heartland, the colony was well isolated from the hustle and bustle of city life. 
It was home to about a hundred senior families from all over India, many of whom had their sons and daughters living in various parts of the world.
