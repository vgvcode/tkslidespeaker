July 13, 2084: The price for freedom?

There has been a mad rush for tickets! 
Only 10% of the seats in The Utopia are for open for sale. 
The rest have to be selected by a rigorous, vetting process. 
As of today, applications for an open seat in the SS Utopia are oversubscribed two thousand times! 
That means there are two thousand applicants for each seat! 
Want to guess the price of an open ticket? 
It is currently being sold for over $25 million! 
My fellow human beings' zest to leave their trusted home never ceases to amaze me!
