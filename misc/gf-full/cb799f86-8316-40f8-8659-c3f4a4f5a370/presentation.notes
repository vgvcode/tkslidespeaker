When I came back from work that evening, the typewriter was gone. 
"Hey, what happened to the old typewriter I had here?
" I asked my wife. 
"We had our cleaning maid in today. 
She might have cleaned up the table and put it aside somewhere. 
Check the drawers and cupboards," my wife said. 
I spent a few minutes rummaging the drawers and checking the cupboards, but the typewriter was nowhere to be found. 
A dreaded thought crossed my mind that I might never see it again. 
What a shame it would be if we had thrown it away! 
I made a note to do a more thorough search on the weekend.
