Sometimes it is better not to seek closure on events. 
It may be a blessing in disguise to leave unanswered questions remain unanswered. 
One such incident happened to me a few days ago I was on a short visit to Chennai, my native place. 
I was planning to leave for the US later that evening. 
I had just a few hours before my flight, and I still had one important task to complete. 
That was to meet Mr. 
Periyasamy, my high school teacher and mathematics guru.
