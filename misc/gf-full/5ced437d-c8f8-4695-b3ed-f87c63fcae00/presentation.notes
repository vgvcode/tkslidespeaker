July 11, 2084: A one-way ticket.

We don't need to remind anyone this is a one-way ticket. 
The Utopia is expected to travel several hundred years before it can find a habitable home, if ever there is one. 
And if it doesn't find one, The Utopia might end up as an orbiting asteroid of a distant planet. 
Under no circumstances, is it expected to return to Earth. 
Let me repeat that. 
The SS Utopia is on a ONE-WAY TRIP TO A FAR AWAY PLANET, with a 1% chance of reaching its destination. 
After it travels a few million miles, it will no longer be able to call home. 
It will take several years for the messages to reach Earth and come back to the space ship.
