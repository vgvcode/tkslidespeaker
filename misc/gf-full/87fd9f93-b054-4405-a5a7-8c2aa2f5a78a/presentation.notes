It was a warm Sunday morning. 
Dev's parents' house was bustling with activity that day. 
Dev's mom was up earlier than usual, preparing food in the kitchen. 
Dad was checking his wardrobe for the proper attire to wear for the occasion. 
Dev's sister Aparna was in charge of cleaning the house. 
Grandmother was wondering what all the fuss was about, until Aparna explained to her. 
Dev was going to bring his girlfriend to their house that morning.
