Grandmother began to reminisce about the days when grandfather met her for the first time. 
It was in her parents' house, in a controlled setting with all the family members from either side being present. 
She recollected, half jokingly, that it was almost like a job interview. 
First there was the usual song and dance (minus the dance in this case; grandmother wouldn't dance but impressed everyone with her rendition of a classical Carnatic music song popular in those days). 
Then the elders gathered in the family room over sweets and savories, trying to appear casual while asking probing questions of 'the boy' and 'the girl'. 
The boy and girl were ushered into a private room for a short face to face discussion. 
And that is how Harry met Sally. 
And the rest of course, is history. 
But I digress.
