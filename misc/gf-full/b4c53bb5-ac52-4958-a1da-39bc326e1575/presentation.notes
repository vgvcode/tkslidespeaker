With a newly launched website, Kesav's old wedding planning business acquired a face lift and gamely took on the new world order created by COVID-19. 
So, what services would his website provide? 
Here's an excerpt from the site itself: Conduct your weddings online, without fear of COVID-19. 
Perform religious ceremonies, take your vows, invite your family and friends, and get married, all from the comfort of your home.
