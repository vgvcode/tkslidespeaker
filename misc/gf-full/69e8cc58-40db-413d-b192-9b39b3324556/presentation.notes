It was already past 8pm. 
I had only another three hours before my flight. 
So I decided to take the address and check on it later. 
The neighbor noticed the small package I was carrying. 
'You can leave the package at the management office, on your way back. 
They may have left for the day, but you can drop it off in their mailbox. 
They might be able to forward it to Mr. 
Balu'. 
I dropped the package at the office with a note and my email address. 
I spent an agonizing 24 hours flying back to the US, trying to cheer myself with happy reminiscences.
