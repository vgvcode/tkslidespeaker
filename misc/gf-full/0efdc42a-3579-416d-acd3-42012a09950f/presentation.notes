July 4, 2084: Draft begins on Independence Day.

Today is first day for the roll call for Space Ship Utopia. 
The date for the draft was symbolically set on US Independence Day, to denote the liberation of mankind. 
The plan is to fill up the space ship with able bodied men and women mostly under the age of fifty, from all walks of life. 
There will be doctors, farmers, engineers and various other professionals. 
The list will include children too. 
And various plants and animals as well. 
A 21st century version of Noah's ark, if you will.
