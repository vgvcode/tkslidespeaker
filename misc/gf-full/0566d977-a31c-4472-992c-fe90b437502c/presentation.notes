June 10, 2084: The SS Utopia.
 
However, all is not lost. 
There is a lot of room for optimism. 
The SS Utopia is finally here! 
Call it a crusade to save humanity and all forms of life as we know it. 
A mission to propagate our peaceful way of existence beyond Earth. 
An exploratory voyage that can pave the way for humans to set up colonies in space. 
Space ship Utopia is our answer for all of the above. 
Hope springs eternal!
