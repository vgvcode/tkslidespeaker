Aug 1, 2084: I'm selected! 


The initial batch of 100,000 have been drafted. 
I'm one of the few who has been selected. 
I will be an engineer in charge of the on-board computers. 
I have decided to go, but leave family behind. 
It is a tearful moment as I announce this to my family. 
I sign up bravely, inspired by the mission to protect our way of life.
