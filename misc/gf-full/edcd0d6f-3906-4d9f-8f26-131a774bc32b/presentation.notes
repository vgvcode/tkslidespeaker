July 1, 2084: But, what are our chances? 


Even if all goes well, scientists do not give more than a 1% chance that The Utopia will reach its intended destination. 
It has to survive the harsh realities of outer space and travel for more than 500 million miles! 
A feat of this magnitude has never been attempted before. 
And once we reach our destination, no one knows what we will find there. 
Would there be some form of hostile life already in that planet? 
This is somewhat like the early explorers who set out to explore other continents by sea over five hundred years ago. 
Armed with nothing more than courage and a huge leap of faith!
