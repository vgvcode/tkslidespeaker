Tailpiece Three weeks later: Based on a tip, police arrested a man at Mumbai International Airport, in the business class lounge of a major airline. 
The man, in his early forties, was carrying with him a small bag full of designer eyeglasses, several smartphones and tablets. 
SIM cards found in his possession were later traced to customers who had lodged complaints about 'ransomware' attacks on their phones.
