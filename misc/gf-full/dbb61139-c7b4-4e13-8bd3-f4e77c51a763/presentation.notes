"For that, we need to take a stroll through the temple grounds. 
Do you have time?
", Mani asked.
Kittu could hardly contain his curiosity. 
The bus ride back to Chennai can wait, he decided, and gladly obliged.
Mani took Kittu through the familiar corridors of the temple and to the ground nearby.
There was a big crowd gathered there. 
They were waiting for a famous Swami to show up. 
He was going to speak on Saint Ramanuja on the occasion of his centenary birth anniversary.
