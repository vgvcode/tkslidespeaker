A few nervous minutes later, the pilot again made an announcement. 
'We are making an emergency landing at London Heathrow to have doctors attend to the sick passenger. 
We request all passengers to remain seated when we land'. 
When the flight landed, the passengers eagerly looked out of the windows to see what was happening. 
Outside on the tarmac, they could see a few Ambulance vehicles swarm near the plane. 
Someone was being escorted in a stretcher. 
After about thirty minutes, the pilot spoke again. 
'Folks, the passenger has been handed over to the medical emergency team. 
We wish the person a speedy recovery. 
Please stay in your seats while we continue our flight to Mumbai'.
