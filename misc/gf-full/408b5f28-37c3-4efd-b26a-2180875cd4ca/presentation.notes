Dec 31, 2084: Bon Voyage.

I'm sending this email from aboard the SS Utopia. 
All 100,000 are on board! 
We are ready for the grand voyage to discover a second home. 


It is an emotional moment for all of us as the giant space ship untethers itself from its docking station and steers into space. 
As we drift off into the abyss, we pay one last homage to Mother Earth.
