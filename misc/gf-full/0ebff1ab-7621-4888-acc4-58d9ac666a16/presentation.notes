Was it even worth it? 
As I pondered over this question, one thing became clear to me. 
A lot of things have changed over the years, yet some things really haven't changed. 
People still love a good story, in whichever medium it is published. 
If the content is interesting and palatable, I may still have a chance. 
In fact, people read more these days, not less. 
The channels have increased, from traditional paper books to digital, audio, blogs and social networks and so on. 
But people are selective. 
Content is King!
