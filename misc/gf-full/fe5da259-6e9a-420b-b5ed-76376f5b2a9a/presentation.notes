Aug 15, 2084: Lift Off.

It was a clear, blue sky at Cape Canaveral, Florida. 
The first lift off happened precisely at 10:04 am Eastern time. 
Needless to say, a huge crowd had gathered for the event. 
It was televised around the world and watched live by more than a billion viewers. 
After about 4 hours, the rocket that left Cape Canaveral docked with its mother ship. 
The first few voyagers entered The Utopia and the rocket reentered the earth for its next mission. 
For the next four months from Aug 15 Dec 15, there were multiple rocket launches. 
Each launch carried about 500 people.
