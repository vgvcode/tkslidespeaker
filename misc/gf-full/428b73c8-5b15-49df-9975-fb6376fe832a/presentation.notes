Aug 3, 2084: Training for space travel.
We are undergoing extensive training to survive outer space. 
We are being taken on a trial ride to outer space and back, to see how well we can cope up with the artificial environment inside the space craft. 
A backup list of 300,000 was created, in case there are fallouts from the initial list.
