There was no mistake about it. 
My Dad's typewriter had sprung back to life. 
It was talking back to me in its familiar old typewriter font. 
The letters I used to love (and miss so much) leaped out of the paper and started dancing in front of me. 
Some were smudged a little, others felt like they could use some extra ink. 
And there was that familiar 'm' that seemed tantalizingly similar to the 'n' on some lines. 
It was my dad's Brother Valiant, no doubt, back in business! 
But who fixed it?
