Our company has over 50 patents, a number that is growing rapidly every year. 
When our employees come up with new product designs, I always ask them to make sure it is their own. 
This practice has given us a stellar track record and helped us lead the industry with truly innovative ideas. 
Years ago, I learnt a lesson about Honesty and Ethics from Mr. 
Raghuram's father, Sri Srinivasa Shastry, the principal of Srinivasa Matriculation High School in Chennai. 
It is a memory that I will cherish forever. 
Hence, as a gesture of gratitude to his father, I have decided to offer this position to Mr. 
Raghuram Shastry.
