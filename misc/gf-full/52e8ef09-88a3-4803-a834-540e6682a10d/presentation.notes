June 15, 2084: A technological marvel! 


Almost a hundred years ago, around 1980 if I'm right, our ancestors wrote epic stories such as Star Wars describing intergalactic travel. 
Today, we're almost there. 
The SS Utopia has been developed by a World Consortium of engineers and scientists. 
The giant space ship was built entirely in space. 
It needed more than a hundred docking stations and a hundred thousand round trips from earth to transport the raw materials and engineers. 
It took over a decade of hard work by engineers and scientists from all over the world. 
A true technological marvel!
