Over the last thirty years, the student teacher relationship between me and Periyasamy had blossomed into one of friendship and mutual respect. 
He was a wonderful human being and a great conversationalist almost a stark difference from the strict disciplinarian he used to be at high school! 
Periyasamy loved to hear about my experiences in the USA and follow up on how his old students were doing. 
He had a remarkable ability to recall names of hundreds of his students across several years in high school! 
He had never traveled abroad. 
But he was a well read man with wide ranging interests.
