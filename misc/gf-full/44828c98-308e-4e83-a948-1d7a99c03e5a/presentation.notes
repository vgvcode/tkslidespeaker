Periyasamy's math classes in high school were a great inspiration for many to pursue higher studies in engineering. 
Yours truly, included. 
His unique methods to teach Calculus to high school students were worthy of a management school study. 
He had the uncanny knack to descend to the level of the students and talk to them more like a friend than like a teacher. 
He was not a big fan of trying to discipline students through fear, terror or insults. 
He was a gentle, yet strict disciplinarian. 
With a self effacing humor, he used to feign ignorance when confronted with a question, often to kindle the curiosity of students to think for themselves. 
Needless to say, this stimulated the students' interest in the subject. 
Year after year, our school used to break all records in competitive entrance tests and national board exams. 
Today, he has a very loyal following of former students all over the world, many of whom are renowned scientists, engineers and financial wizards!
