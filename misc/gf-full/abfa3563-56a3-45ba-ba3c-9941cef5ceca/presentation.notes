Som liked to describe himself as a venture capitalist. 
He always bragged about how he could spot a great idea from a merely good one. 
He was an early investor in many startup technology companies. 
Some of them, truth be told, did quite well and helped Som make quite a fortune. 
Yet, Som was far from failure proof. 
Once in a while, his ventures backfired spectacularly, earning him the nickname 'Adventure Capitalist'. 
But perhaps what Som was best known for, was his 'misadventure' that happened during a recent business trip.
