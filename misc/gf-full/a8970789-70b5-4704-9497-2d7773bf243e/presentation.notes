You can download the app from there. 
Here is the wearable you need to use with it.

Som proceeded to install the app on his phone. 
By the time he was done, the young man was nowhere to be seen.

The next few hours passed by uneventfully in flight. 
Som shut off his phone and made a mental note to check out the profile of 'AJ, CTO Think-O-Vate Systems' when he got back.
