Here are some intelligent machines you may have seen in the market.

In 2005, we had a vacuum cleaner that could automatically clean the floors. It used the AI technology developed earlier to navigate through mazes and obstacles. 

In 2009, we had the first driver-less car from Google. Today, the technology has improved a lot, and we see lots of driver-less cars being manufactured in US and Europe.

In 2014, we had the Voice Assistant Alexa from Amazon. In fact, from 2011 onwards, various voice assistants started emerging from Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon. These had the capability to listen, understand and talk back in a natural sounding voice.
