Store the output in s3 bucket b / folder f
Set bucket policy to allow access to a specific role r
In the config file create profile p to assume role r
    # In ~/.aws/credentials:
    [development]
    aws_access_key_id=foo
    aws_access_key_id=bar

    # In ~/.aws/config
    [profile p]
    role_arn=arn:aws:iam:...r
    source_profile=development

In python
    set the session to the specific profile
    import boto3

    session = boto3.Session(profile_name='p')
    #set a time limit for the session
    dev_s3_client = session.client('s3')

    write a function to download files recursively from s3 to local folder
